Hi! I’m Leah. I'm an apprentice at Nashville Software School, an amateur baker, a gamer, a sometimes-writer, and a lover of learning.

I'm currently working on: Python, Django REST framework, React, and algorithmic thinking in Javascript.

Before my apprenticeship at Nashville Software School, I was an HR Assistant. In just three years, I advanced from an onboarding help-desk position on a team of 20 to the sole onboarding specialist at a national healthcare company. In my previous career, I was congratulated on my hardworking and kind nature and my ability to proactively solve problems, but my biggest sense of pride came from being the go-to person for questions from peers. This has continued in the development world, as my peers at NSS voted me "The Human Magnet: The student that everyone goes to with questions."

Though I was succeeding in HR and loved the aspects of teamwork, I felt that it did not have the types of challenges that have always excited me throughout school and in my free time. I wanted to exercise the logical side of my brain and to really be able to have the continuous learning I crave. My goal is to bring my drive, my helpful spirit, and my want to learn to a junior developer position. I'm looking for a position where I can continue to grow my skills, solve coding mysteries, and support a team with a great culture.
