Hi! I’m Leah. I'm an apprentice at Nashville Software School, an amateur baker, a gamer, a sometimes-writer, and a lover of learning.

I'm currently working on: Python, Django REST framework, React, and algorithmic thinking in Javascript.

Check out my personal website here: https://leahdaniel.github.io/

Projects to check out on my Github:

- Trove: my front-end capstone, built with React, Javascript, JSON, and CSS/Reactstrap.
- Coming soon... a re-write of my front-end capstone using server-side Python and Django, and a final full-stack capstone for the end of my NSS journey.
