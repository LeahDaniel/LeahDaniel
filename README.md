Hi! I’m Leah. I'm an apprentice at Nashville Software School, graduating at the end of March 2022.

I'm currently working on: Python, Django REST framework, React, and algorithmic thinking in Javascript.

Check out my personal website here: https://leahdaniel.github.io/

Projects to check out on my Github:

- Trove: my front-end capstone, built with React, Javascript, JSON, and CSS/Reactstrap. Repos: trove & trove-api
- Trove Rebuilt: a full-stack version of my front-end capstone with Django REST and Python. Repos: trove-client & trove-server
- Coming soon... a final full-stack capstone for the end of my NSS journey.
